# Adaptive Reachability Analysis for Safe Driving in Mixed Platoons

This repository contains the implementation and report of a project developed during the **Practical Course "Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles"** at the Technical University of Munich (WS 2023/24), under the supervision of **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Matthias Althoff**, **Di Liu**, and **Simone Baldi**.

The work investigates the effects of human-driven disturbances in **mixed platoons** of vehicles and applies adaptive **reachability analysis** to model, quantify, and simulate safety boundaries in such scenarios.

> ðŸš— Focus: Continuous Reachability Analysis with nonlinear vehicle dynamics in mixed platoons using CORA.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Description

The project explores how disturbancesâ€”originating from human-driven vehiclesâ€”affect the safety margins of a single automated vehicle at the end of a vehicle convoy (mixed platoon).

The simulation is grounded in the **Optimal Velocity Model (OVM)** and focuses on key state variables:

- Spacing error `eáµ¢`
- Relative velocity `Î½áµ¢`
- Acceleration `aáµ¢`

The system is modeled as a **nonlinear differential equation** and analyzed via **reachable sets**, computed using the [CORA Toolbox](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/pages/continuous-systems/index.html), developed by the TUM Chair of Cyber-Physical Systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This project builds directly on the **CORA Toolbox**, which offers state-of-the-art methods for reachability analysis in continuous systems.  
All results and simulations rely on CORAâ€™s methods for nonlinear system analysis and zonotope representations. Some placeholder references or comments in the code/report are part of the student draft and should be interpreted accordingly.
